This is a admin theme that i intend to use for a lot of projects.
The theme utilizes RequireJS to lazy-load load javascript files.
It can automaticly detect if a certain script is required.  
  
The theme is MIT licensed, so you can basically do with it whatever you want.
In the near future there'll be some examples here showing several methods on how to implement
this theme into different projects like Laravel blade, Github pages/jekyll etc.


- run `grunt tasks` for usefull build tasks 
- [src/styles/readme.md](src/styles/readme.md) for scss structure overview.
